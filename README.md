My Everyday Progress of Learning Cpp

## Day 1
1. Setup mingw and other toolkit for compiling
2. Create hello world program
3. Use mathematical operations with type conversion
	---
		Some notes regarding mathematical functions:
		1. '%' operand works only on *int* data type.
		2. '/' needs the data types to be converted to *double* for exact output, or else it produces an *int* output.
